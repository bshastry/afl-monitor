# afl-monitor
#### Extended monitoring and reporting tool for AFL

This program processes a findings directory generated by afl-fuzz and displays the findings in various formats.

#### Usage
`./afl-monitor [-n | --nocolor] [-c | --commandLine] [-v | --verbose] [-h | --html output_directory] [-e | --execute command] [-r | --recursive second_count]  findings_directory`

The findings_directory parameter should point to an existing findings directory contianing one or several state directories for any active or stopped instance of afl-fuzz.

#### Options
`-n | --nocolor` Supresses color output.

`-c | --commandLine` 
Output to the command line (can be used with -h)

`-v | --verbose` 
Show per-fuzzer statistics in commandline mode and Per-Fuzzer graphing in HTML mode.

`-h | --html` 
Output in HTML format. output_directory must be an empty directory in which the output files will be saved. Will generate 1 index.html file and several plot images.

`-e | --execute` 
Executes the provided command (use quotes if using arguments) and passes the commandline output via stdin (pipe) if a new crash is detected.

`-r | --recursive` 
Re-runs this script with all provided arguments every 'second_count' seconds.

#### Usage Examples

`./afl-monitor -c -v findings/` Display colored status information summaries and per-fuzzer stats on the command line.

`./afl-monitor -g graphs/ -c -n findings/` Display summary information as HTML and uncolored console output.

`./afl-monitor -c -e send_push_message -r 60 findings/` Generate summary stats once a minute and display them on the command line. If a new crash was detected since the last run, pipe the summary into `send_push_message` (placeholder example).

#### Installation

Place afl-monitor anywhere in your file system and execute it. Requires Python 2.7.
